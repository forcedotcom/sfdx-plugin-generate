# Description

## **=== WARNING === This plugin has been deprecated and is no longer supported. Please use the [salesforcecli/plugin-dev](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-dev) plugin instead.**

This is the generator plugin for building plugins for the Salesforce CLI. The generated sfdx plugin and command are built on top of the [oclif cli framework](https://github.com/oclif/oclif). A plug-in adds functionality to Salesforce CLI. Some plug-ins are provided by Salesforce and are installed by default when you install the CLI. Some plug-ins, built by Salesforce and others, you install. When you have a requirement that an existing plug-in doesn’t meet, you can build your own using Node.js.

**Note:** As of @salesforce/command@1.3.0, if you want to override the static usage property you must use a getter. For consistency, we recommend keeping the standard behavior rather than overriding the usage property.

# Usage

## Check Your Salesforce CLI Version

Starting with Salesforce CLI version 6.8.2, the plug-in generator is offered as a core plugin and can be used out of the box. To check your Salesforce CLI version:

```
$ sfdx --version
sfdx-cli/6.42.0-ae478b3cb8 (darwin-x64) node-v8.9.4
```

## Generate a Salesforce CLI Plugin

Follow the **[Salesforce CLI Plug-In Developer Guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins.htm) **to create and update your plug-in. In the guide you will discover how to develop your own plug-ins for Salesforce CLI. Explore the Salesforce CLI architecture. Learn how to generate a plug-in using Salesforce Plug-In Generator, how to use Salesforce’s libraries to add functionality to your plug-in, and how to debug issues.
